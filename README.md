# A Groovy Experience

I have unfortunately found myself needing to interact with a significant amount of [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) code.

From my past I'm aware that the developer experience with Groovy is the developer equivalent of having that thing below your midriff removed by force with poorly maintained shears (several parallels here, really).

The point of this repo is to analyse the tools available, nothing too in-depth, with the hope of finding some light in this dark and ancient place.

To read more about Groovy-specific dev-tools, head [here](./groovy-tools.md).

For language-independent tools which may be some support, head [here](./lang-indep-tools.md).
